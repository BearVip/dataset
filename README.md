The dataset of livestream


A group of five social media personalities runs an online streaming channel, where they live stream videos of themselves playing various computer games. Any one of the group members can produce this content, and can choose what they want it to involve.

Over the last three years, the group has collected information about a random sample of their live streams.

The variables they can provide you with are as follows:

viewers: the number of people who watched the video live (anyone who catches up with the recording later is not included here);

genre: the type of game being played;

host: the main host of the live stream (either Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4 or Player5);

subscribers: the total number of subscribers to their channel at the start of the previous week;

day: the day of the week on which the live stream was filmed;

season: the season in which the live stream was filmed (Spring, Summer, Autumn or Winter);

guests: the number of guest players included in the live stream;

ads_now: the number of adverts in the live stream;

ads_last: the number of adverts in the previous live stream.

The dataset is contained within the file live_streams.csv. The observations in the dataset are given in the order they were collected.
